 <course> reading, interpreting, composing, and improvising music; they will develop, and participate in, a community committed </course> 

 <course> to improving musical skills, and learning from one another. Learning these skills will enable lifelong learning, through </course>

 <course> Rethinking Children and Youth </course> 

 <course> 4 Semester Credits </course> 

 <course> Children and youth are often expected to be seen and not heard. This course will develop an appreciative understanding </course> 

 <course> of children and youth that will allow us to engage them as assets and agents of positive change. We will explore the </course> 

 <course> history of childhood in North America as well as the historical emergence and cultural construction of adolescence in the </course> 

 <course> 20th century. We will develop a critical lens of this construction in order to free ourselves from our limited and low </course> 

 <course> expectations of children and youth in society. We will then construct a new framework that will enable us to understand </course> 

 <course> and engage young people as powerful, contributing members of society. </course>
